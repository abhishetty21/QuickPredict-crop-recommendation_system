🌾 Crop Recommendation System using Machine Learning
This project is a Crop Recommendation System that uses a machine learning model to suggest the most suitable crop based on soil parameters provided by the user. It is built using Streamlit for an interactive web interface and trained on agricultural data to make smart crop predictions.

🚀 Features
Input soil parameters such as:

Nitrogen (N)
Phosphorus (P)
Potassium (K)
Temperature (°C)
Humidity (%)
pH
Rainfall (mm)

Get an instant prediction of the most suitable crop.
User-friendly interface built with Streamlit.
Lightweight and easy to deploy.

🧠 How it Works
The machine learning model takes in soil and weather data, processes it, and returns the most suitable crop from a predefined list. It has been trained on a comprehensive dataset using supervised learning algorithms.

🛠️ Tech Stack
Python
Streamlit
Scikit-learn / Machine Learning Model
Pandas / NumPy
Matplotlib / Seaborn (for visualizations, if applicable)

📦 Installation
Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/crop-recommendation-system.git
cd crop-recommendation-system

Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

▶️ How to Run
To start the Streamlit app, run the following command in your terminal:

streamlit run sec.py
The app will open in your default web browser at http://localhost:8501.

🧪 Sample Inputs
You’ll be asked to enter the following values:

Nitrogen: e.g., 90
Phosphorus: e.g., 42
Potassium: e.g., 43
Temperature: e.g., 23.5
Humidity: e.g., 82.2
pH: e.g., 6.5
Rainfall: e.g., 200

📊 Output
After entering the above values, the system will predict the most suitable crop for cultivation under those conditions, e.g., "Rice".
